# Agent Instructions

Rules AI agents must follow when working in this repository.

---

## Commit messages

Use **Conventional Commits**.

### Header

* Format: `<type>(optional scope): summary`
* Use lowercase types (`feat`, `fix`, `ci`, `chore`, `docs`)
* Use scopes when relevant
* Write summaries in lowercase, imperative mood

### Body

* Leave a blank line after the header
* Explain **why**, not what
* Use imperative, present tense
* Wrap lines at ~72 characters

The body is optional for trivial changes.

---

## Commits

When generating commits via a shell:

* Do **not** pass generated messages directly to `git commit -m`
* Write the commit message to a file or standard input
* Use `git commit -F <file>` or `git commit -F -`
* Disable shell expansion when writing commit messages

This avoids issues with backticks, quotes, and other shell-expanded characters in
generated commit messages.

---

## Release tags

* Use the bare version as the tag name — **no `v` prefix** (e.g. `0.1.0a4`, not `v0.1.0a4`)
* Tags must be annotated (`git tag -a`) with a structured release-notes message
* CI verifies the tag against `pyproject.toml` and `server.json` before it publishes
  anything; a mismatch — a `v` prefix included — fails the build rather than being
  silently rewritten

---

## Attribution

Every AI-assisted commit, tag, PR, comment, reply, or message an agent writes for
someone must carry an `Assisted-by` trailer:

```
Assisted-by: AGENT_NAME:MODEL_VERSION [TOOL1] [TOOL2]
```

| Field             | Description                                               |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `AGENT_NAME`      | AI tool or framework (e.g. `Claude`, `Cursor`, `Copilot`) |
| `MODEL_VERSION`   | Specific model (e.g. `claude-opus-4-6`)                   |
| `[TOOL1] [TOOL2]` | Optional specialized analysis tools; omit everyday tools  |

* Place it at the **end**, after a blank line: a git trailer in commits, the last line
  of the body everywhere else.
* Skip it only for text the user dictates verbatim.
* Use only `Assisted-by` — no `Co-Authored-By`, no `Made with …`, no hand-written `Sent
  using …`, no other footers.

Example:

```
Assisted-by: Claude:claude-opus-4-6 coccinelle sparse
```

## Code style

Follow existing project conventions.

* Match formatting, naming, and file structure already in use
* Wrap prose and Markdown matching `line-length` in `pyproject.toml`; leave code blocks,
  tables, and URLs unwrapped
* Do not reformat unrelated code
* Prefer small, focused changes
* Avoid introducing new patterns without clear benefit

### Language-specific rules

* Respect `.editorconfig` when present
* Do not disable lint rules without justification
* Prefer explicit, readable code over clever abstractions
* Ensure all changes pass `ruff check .`, `ruff format --check .`, `pyright`, and
  `pytest`

---

## `uv` Workflow Rules

* Use `uv` exclusively for dependency management instead of `pip`
* Always prefix tool and script invocations with `uv run` so they execute inside the
  managed environment
* Do not manually create, activate, or delete `.venv` directories
* Bump the project version with `uv run python scripts/bump_version.py <new-version>` — it drives
  `uv version` and propagates the result to `server.json`, which carries the version twice; do
  **not** edit `pyproject.toml` directly
* Always commit `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, and `server.json` together after a version bump

---

## Vendor neutrality

This server fronts **any** OpenAPI service. Nothing in `src/`, `tests/`,
`config.example.json` or the docs may name a specific vendor, brand, product, internal
hostname, or employer.

* Example configs use `example.com` and placeholder names (`acme`, `items`)
* A behavior that exists because one upstream happens to work a certain way is
  documented by the **property** it relies on, never by who it was observed in
* Vendor-specific login belongs in a token helper, in its own repository — see
  `docs/token-protocol.md`
* The `[OpenAPI]` tool-description prefix required below names the protocol this server
  speaks, not a vendor, and is not an exception to this rule

---

## MCP Metadata

Normative, high-density metadata: enough for correct tool and parameter selection,
minimal to reduce token cost.

* **The tool/parameter description MUST start with [OpenAPI], followed by a Verb-Object
  fragment**, e.g. `[OpenAPI] Execute an API operation`, `[OpenAPI] List OpenAPI
  operations`, `[OpenAPI] Get the full OpenAPI schema`.
* **Use tag-based lineage (Src: <Entity>) for parameters that refer to entities the
  server can enumerate** (e.g. platform → Src: platforms, region → Src: regions, service
  → Src: services, operation id → Src: operations).
* **Every tool MUST declare `ToolAnnotations`** — hints, not guarantees, that a host
  turns into a consent prompt.
* `read_only_hint=True` claims the tool changes nothing anywhere: writing a local file
  is a change.
* `destructive_hint` and `idempotent_hint` matter only when `read_only_hint=False` — set
  both there, omit both otherwise. Both are positive claims: `destructive_hint=False`
  promises additive-only writes, `idempotent_hint=True` promises a repeat call with the
  same arguments has no further effect.
* `open_world_hint` tracks the domain of interaction, not the I/O — `False` only when
  that domain is fixed at build time (bundled data, local config).
